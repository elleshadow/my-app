## React Architecture
- [ ] A consistent, modular file structure is used.
- [ ] A clear understanding of class components vs function components is demonstrated.
- [ ] Only the data that a child component needs is passed down as props.
- [ ] Logic is kept out of return statements; return statements are as readable as possible, only communicating what will be displayed.
- [ ] Fetch calls have been refactored to be reusable for multiple queries.
- [ ] Frontend data (state) always matches the backend data.
- [ ] Data fetched from API is run through a cleaning function (which is defined in a separate utilities file).
- [ ] Implements excellent error handling if movie database server is down or fetch fails (this includes loading images as well as error messages on the frontend).

## Testing
- [ ] Team has successfully achieved 90%+ test coverage of all components.
- [ ] All async functionality is stubbed and tested.
- [ ] Async tests cover happy & sad paths.
- [ ] All application views are tested.
- [ ] All user flows are tested.

## Routing
- [ ] Application has been refactored to use Router without leaving artifacts of the prior code (no odd workarounds remaining).
- [ ] Use of Router shows developer empathy (readability, maintainability).
- [ ] UX is excellent; routes are consistent and navigation is clear.
- [ ] When the user enters a bad URL, they are given an easy way to navigate to a working page.
