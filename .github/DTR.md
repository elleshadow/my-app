## Communication: 

### How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other? 

1. Slack
    * A dedicated Slack channel will be created for async communication. 
    * Any communication directed at a specific team member will be tagged with @name. 
    * Communication intended for all team members will be tagged with @here.
    * Team members will check slack for updates as often as possible, at least once per day. 
    * Team members will respond to Slack as soon as it is reasonable, and although not restricted, will not be expected to respond during class times, or times when focusing on other work.


1. Working Sessions
    * Each working session will begin with a brief daily stand up, tracked in Figma, where we will discuss the following:

        1. Personal
            1. How are you doing today?
            1. Is there anything you need to say or do in order to be fully present for the session?

        1. Professional
            1. What did you do on this project, yesterday?
            1. What are you planning to do on this project, today?
            1. What, if anything, is blocking you? 
            1. Is there anything else you need from any of the members of the team?

1. Schedule Changes
    * Team members should make their best announce any schedule changes, or new restrictions via Slack, as soon as the change is known, to allow other members ample time to adjust their schedules accordingly. **This including if you will be late to a session.**

1. Pull Requests
    * Pull Requests will be submitted at the end of the
## Workflow Expectations: 

### What commitments do you want to make about your git workflow?

1. Team members will make best efforts to avoid coding to their local Main branch.
1. Github branch protection will be used on the Main branch, meaning all commits must be made to a branch other than Main, and submitted via a pull request before they can be merged. 
1. Team members will fill out all necessissary sections of the pull request template for each pull request.
4. Each pull request will include coorisponding project board issue numbers. 
4. Each team member not submitting the pull request must be added as a reviewer. In some cases, Mentors will also be added as reviewers; however, because of scheduling, their partisapation is not required to proceed.
1. Once a pull request is submitted, the team member who submitted the pull request must announce it to the slack channel with "@here, Pull Request Available, please submit your reviews by X time" (note, we are all busy, please allow a few *business* hours, at least, for reviews to be completed)
1. Each team member will acknoledge the request, including the review deadline, by adding a green check mark react to the slack message, at their earliest convienence.
    * In the event the requested review deadline does not work for any team member, that team member will reply in a thread, to that slack message with their counter offer, ie I can't review by 6pm today, but I can review before 10am tomorrow.
1. After committing what they are currently working on, each reviewer will:
    1. git fetch.
    1. git pull the new branch. 
    2. Run npm test, insuring all tests pass, even if the PR has no affect on testing, its safer if everyone checks every time. 
1. Each reviewer must submit an approval within their code review before the branch can be merged. This is distinct from leaving a comment.
5. The final reviewer to submit a code review is the only person permitted to merge changes. (Mentor reviews are not required to merge, and can be added at a later time, based on their schedule)
1. Once a pull request is merged, the team member merging the pull request must announce it to the slack channel with "@here, Merge complete, please checkout main and pull" 
1. Each team member will pull down from main, *before* acknoledging the message adding a green check mark react, at their earliest convienence. This is mostly to let everyone know there were no issues pulling from main. 
6. Consistent naming conventions. Ask the slack channle if you dont know what to name something. 
7. The team member merging the pull request will announce it on slack.

### Pom Schedule: 

## What will out pom schedule be and how will we hold each other accountable to it? 

1. We would like to to Pom often. We will aim for around 45 minutes of work time, then taking a 10-15 minutes pom depending on how we feel. Rio will be responsible for setting a pom timer. After 3/4 work sessions in a row we will take a longer pom of 20-30 minutes. 

### Productive Work: 

## How will we ensure that we are struggling productively and not going down rabbit holes? 

1. If a single session has elasped and we are still stuck on the same problem. We will alkl break off to do our independent reseach and meet up to discuss, or we will reach out to other groups in the study hall. 

### Troubleshooting: 

## What process will we use when we encounter disagreements/conflicts with one another? What steps will we take to come together as a functional team? 

1. We will first refer to the DTR to see if we can solve it there. Otherwise we will take the approach to solve problems that will result in the most net growth. We want to take the path that leads to learning rather than the most efficiency. 

## Growth Mindset: 

### How will you implement the feedback from previous projects in this project? 

1. Right now by taking the time to do sufficient planning. 
2. Taking time to slow down and focus on the planning phase.
3. Reading and re-reading so that you are very clear on what is being asked.
