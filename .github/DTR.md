## Communication: 

### How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other? 

1. We will commmunicate daily wiht daily stand ups. What did you work on yesteday, what are we going to do today, what blocking you? Communication will be done through our slack channel and and zoom.

## Workflow Expectations:

4. Include relavant issue numbers. 
4. Always put the other two team members as reviewers.

### Pom Schedule: 

## What will out pom schedule be and how will we hold each other accountable to it? 

1. We would like to to Pom often. We will aim for around 45 minutes of work time, then taking a 10-15 minutes pom depending on how we feel. Rio will be responsible for setting a pom timer. After 3/4 work sessions in a row we will take a longer pom of 20-30 minutes. 

### Productive Work: 

## How will we ensure that we are struggling productively and not going down rabbit holes? 

1. If a single session has elasped and we are still stuck on the same problem. We will alkl break off to do our independent reseach and meet up to discuss, or we will reach out to other groups in the study hall. 

### Troubleshooting: 

## What process will we use when we encounter disagreements/conflicts with one another? What steps will we take to come together as a functional team? 

1. We will first refer to the DTR to see if we can solve it there. Otherwise we will take the approach to solve problems that will result in the most net growth. We want to take the path that leads to learning rather than the most efficiency. 

## Growth Mindset: 

### How will you implement the feedback from previous projects in this project? 

1. Right now by taking the time to do sufficient planning. 
2. Taking time to slow down and focus on the planning phase.
3. Reading and re-reading so that you are very clear on what is being asked.
